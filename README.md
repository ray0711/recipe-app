# Rice Cooker RecipeApp
This is a minimal recipe generator for the Xiaomi Rice Cooker `chunmi.cooker.normal2`.

The generated recipes are potentially <b>dangerous</b> since this is currently based purely on trial and error! 

The starting recipe allows setting a temperature which the cooker keeps for the set cooking time. 
First test shows the cooker keeps the temperature nicely in a range of +-1 degree but you might need to check the temperature offset of the cookers sensor with another thermometer.
